                <p>The Ministry of Magic has launched a new campaign aimed at increasing awareness and understanding of Muggles among witches and wizards. The campaign, titled "Muggles: Our Friends and Neighbors," will feature a series of educational programs, workshops, and public service announcements. The initiative seeks to dispel common misconceptions and promote better relations between the magical and non-magical communities.</p>
                <p>Minister of Magic, Hermione Granger, emphasized the importance of this campaign. "Understanding and respecting Muggles is crucial for the peaceful coexistence of our two worlds. We hope this campaign will foster empathy and cooperation," she stated. The campaign has been met with positive reactions from various wizarding organizations and community leaders.</p>
