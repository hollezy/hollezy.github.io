                <p>The Hogwarts Express departed from Platform 9 3/4 at King's Cross Station promptly at 11 AM this morning, carrying students back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for another exciting year of learning and adventure. The platform was bustling with students, parents, and well-wishers, all eager to see off the young witches and wizards.</p>
                <p>Professor Minerva McGonagall, Headmistress of Hogwarts, was present to ensure a smooth departure. "We are looking forward to welcoming our students back and are excited for the year ahead," she stated. Security measures were visibly enhanced, with Aurors patrolling the station to ensure the safety of everyone present.</p>
