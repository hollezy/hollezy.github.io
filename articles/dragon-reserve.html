                <h2>Dragon Reserve Expands in Romania</h2>
                <img src="../images/dragon.jpg" alt="Dragon">
                <p>The Romanian Dragon Reserve, one of the largest and most important dragon sanctuaries in the world, has announced a significant expansion of its facilities. The expansion includes new habitats for several dragon breeds, including the Norwegian Ridgeback and the Ukrainian Ironbelly. This development aims to provide better living conditions for the dragons and enhance research opportunities for dragonologists.</p>
                <p>Charlie Weasley, a dragonologist working at the reserve, expressed his enthusiasm for the project. "This expansion is crucial for our conservation efforts. It allows us to accommodate more dragons and continue our research into these magnificent creatures," he said. The Ministry of Magic has provided substantial funding for the expansion, recognizing the importance of dragon conservation.</p>
