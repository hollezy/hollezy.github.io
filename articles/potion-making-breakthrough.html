                <p><span class="potion-dropcap">I</span>n a groundbreaking development, a team of potion-makers at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries has discovered a cure for the common cold. The new potion, named "Pepperup Plus," promises to alleviate symptoms within minutes and completely cure the cold within an hour. This is a significant advancement from the traditional Pepperup Potion, which often had side effects like steam coming out of the patient's ears.</p>
                <p>Lead potioneer, Madam Pomfrey, expressed her excitement: "This is a monumental achievement for magical medicine. We believe Pepperup Plus will greatly improve the quality of life for many witches and wizards." Clinical trials have shown a 98% success rate, and the potion is expected to be available to the public by next month.</p>
